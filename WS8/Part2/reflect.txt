In completing this particular workshop, I learned about various concepts related to Raw and Smart Pointers, dynamic memory management and file input/output (I/O), in C++

Advantages of Smart Pointer Syntax:

Smart pointers, such as std::unique_ptr and std::shared_ptr, provide automatic memory management and help prevent memory leaks by automatically deallocating memory when the pointer goes out of scope.
They offer improved safety compared to raw pointers, as they automatically handle memory deallocation and prevent issues like double deletion or memory leaks.
An example from the provided code where smart pointer syntax could be advantageous is in the allocation and deallocation of memory for Product objects. 
Instead of using raw pointers and manually deleting objects, using std::unique_ptr<Product> could ensure automatic memory management without the need for explicit deallocation.

Difference Between Raw and Smart Pointer Syntax:

In the provided solution, raw pointer syntax (Product* product = new Product(desc[i].desc, price[j].price);) is used for manual memory allocation, and delete is used for manual memory deallocation (delete product;).
Smart pointer syntax, on the other hand, would involve using std::unique_ptr<Product> or std::shared_ptr<Product> to automatically manage memory allocation and deallocation, eliminating the need for manual memory management.
Using smart pointers can help simplify memory management, improve code safety, and prevent memory-related bugs such as memory leaks or dangling pointers.
Challenges and Solutions:

One challenge I encountered was ensuring proper memory management and avoiding memory leaks when working with dynamically allocated objects. 
To address this challenge, I carefully reviewed the code and used appropriate memory management techniques, such as using delete for raw pointers or using smart pointers where applicable.
Another challenge was correctly handling file I/O operations, including error handling and end-of-file detection. To overcome this challenge, 
I used error-checking mechanisms such as checking for the end of file and handling file opening errors using exception handling (throw and catch).
Overall, completing this workshop enhanced my understanding of dynamic memory management, file I/O, and object-oriented programming concepts in C++. 
It allowed me to apply these concepts to a real-world problem and develop a robust solution using appropriate memory management techniques and file I/O operations.
