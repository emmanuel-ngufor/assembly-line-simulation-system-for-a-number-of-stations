General Overview
================
To begin, I would like to say thanks to my Professor : Masood Khan Patel, you were a great teacher and always very helpful.
Although this project was not lengthy as compared to the projects of IPC144 AND OOP244, It required a great deal of technical knowledge 
and patience. I spent several nights wondering why my code is not working the way it should. From countless Youtube videos to several AI tools 
to help me analyse and debug, I am so happy I am done with the project. It was quite tedious and time consuming. Hope this prepares me 
for real world.


Topics covered and Lessons learned
==================================
Overview of C++, Building Blocks of C++, Compilation and Execution
Types: Fundamental types, Pointers, references and Arrays, Classes and Scoped Enumerations
Class Relationships : Inheritance and Inclusion Polymorphism, Class Templates, Compositions, Aggregations and Associations
Processing : Expressions, Functions and Errror Handling
Standard Template Library: STL, Containers and Iterations, Algorithms, File Stream Objects

Challenges
==========
I faced a lot of challenges in completing this project. With a lot of time invested into debugging, I cannot say I had it easy.
It all started well witht the Station Module which was good and chilled. Then came the CustomerOrder Module
Faulty Design: I found myself going back to Milestones 1 and 2 to make changes in order for the  code to work properly. 
My implementation of the CustomerOrder module was one of the most difficult. Ranging from multiple condtions and loops, it was just messy.

The Workstation and LineManager Module gave me a clearer picture as to how the the whole systems functions. This helped me a lot in 
visualising some of the aspects and translating it into code.

Looking Forward
===============
I look forward to develop my skills in C++ over the break before the Summer Term begins. I am particularly interested in reviewing 
and learning about the Standard Template Library, Multi-threading and Deeper Details which were not covered in depth during the semester.
However, there are still many aspects that need explore.
