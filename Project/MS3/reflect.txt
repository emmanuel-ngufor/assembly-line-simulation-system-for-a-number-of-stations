To begin, I have to say this project was way shorter as compared to the previous projects I have completed in IPC144 and OOP244.

General Overview
================
A general overview of the project from my perspective helped me understand a lot more about the Standard Template Library in C++.
Unlike manual loops, it provided me with a more faster and efficient way to deal with containers that can store any kind of data.
The design and structure of the project was properly done and easy to follow.
