1. 
Deallocating Dynamically Allocated Memory in a Vector
Why Deallocation is Necessary:
In C++, when we dynamically allocate memory using new, it's our responsibility to release that memory using delete to prevent memory leaks. 
In the context of a std::vector of pointers (std::vector<seneca::Person*>), each pointer represents an object created with new. 
If we don't deallocate the memory before the vector is destroyed, the memory won't be freed, leading to memory leaks.

2.
Return Error Codes:
Instead of using exceptions, the seneca::buildInstance() function could return an error code indicating the type of error encountered (e.g., unknown type or invalid data).
The loadData() function would then check the error code and handle each type of error accordingly.
Example:

int error = seneca::buildInstance(file);
if (error == UNKNOWN_TYPE)
{
    // Handle unknown type error
}
else if (error == INVALID_DATA)
{
    // Handle invalid data error
}
else if (error == NO_ERROR)
{
    // Continue processing
}

3.
Using Containers of Pointers vs. Objects
std::listseneca::Person* and std::vectorseneca::Person* vs. std::listseneca::Person and std::vectorseneca::Person:
The choice between using containers of pointers (std::list<seneca::Person*> and std::vector<seneca::Person*>)
and containers of objects (std::list<seneca::Person> and std::vector<seneca::Person>) depends on the requirements of the application.

Using Containers of Pointers:
Efficient for polymorphic behavior (storing derived class objects).
Allows heterogeneous collections (different types derived from Person).
Requires manual memory management (deleting objects).
More suitable when objects have a longer lifetime.

std::vector<seneca::Person*> personsVector;
Using Containers of Objects:
Simpler memory management (no need for manual deletion).
Objects are stored directly, reducing indirection.
Suitable when polymorphism is not a requirement.
More straightforward, especially for short-lived objects.

Summary:
Deallocate dynamically allocated memory in a vector to prevent memory leaks.
Use exception handling to detect and handle errors during file parsing.
Choose between containers of pointers and objects based on the application's needs, considering factors like polymorphism and memory management requirements.
